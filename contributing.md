# Contributing

Thanks for making your way to this file, the more the merrier.

If you'd like to contribute to the project you should start by
looking at the [project board](https://github.com/vot/remotestack-player/projects/1)
to see the current list of tasks.

The backlog is rather large (and still growing) so you can pick something for yourself.

Whether you have a bug you'd like to report and potentially fix or you would
like to implement a new feature you should go ahead and
[raise an issue](https://github.com/vot/remotestack-player/issues).

Feel free to create pull requests but please make sure to give
a brief explanation about what your code does.
